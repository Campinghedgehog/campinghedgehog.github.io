Work in progress
[Updated August 22, 2024]

# Past

- ## Hilbert's Program
- ## Gödel, Church, Turing
- ## SAT Solvers
- ## Type Theory
    - Curry-Howard Isomorphism

# Present

- ## The Golden Goose
    - ### RL, no HF (human feedback)
        - AlphaZero
- ## State of the Art
    - ### A note on Kolmogorov Complexity and LLMs
    - ### PPO, DPO, GRPO, RLHF, CoT (chain of thought), PoT (program of thought), MCTS, Lean RAG
    

# Future

- ## Is MCTS proof search enough?

- ## Abstraction
    - ### Grothendieck
    - ### Optimization on Proof Length?

- ## Freeing mathematicians from the Real of Forms
    - what happens when mathematicians do computers
        - Leslie Lamport
    - ### Guides for Abstraction
    - ### Empirical mathematics

- ## 所以呢?
    - ### Discrete Program Synthesis
    - ### Autoformalization
    - ### Verification
        - #### Software Verification
            - Rise of Rust
                - Rust is child's play compared to dependently typed languages
            - Industry mostly uses coverity and the like
                - lots of false positives, pretty slow, simply not ergonomic. same with driver monitoring, there is this fatigue with false positive warnings. It's rules based, 
        - #### Hardware Verification
            - ##### How the sausage is made
                - Verilog/ VHDL
                - Order of magnitude more verification engineers to designers, and growing
                - Formal verificaton
                    - Synopsis and Cadence
                        - compile to circuit, run sat solver... this is state of the art..
                        - million $ very restrictive licenses
                        - [OpenRoad](https://theopenroadproject.org){:target="_blank"} 
                        - if [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com){:target="_blank"}  is not an anomoly, very curious to see what China will produce in this space, especially due to EDA software export controls
            - 1) better chips
            - 2) better models; goto 1)

- ## Coming Full Circle
    - ### [Hilbert's Problems](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertsProblems.html){:target="_blank"} 
    - ### [Millenium Problems](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/){:target="_blank"} 

# Cautious Optimism in The Best of Times in the Best of Worlds

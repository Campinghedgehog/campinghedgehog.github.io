# Natural Right and History

## Chapter 1: Natural Right and the Historical Approach
- Historicism collapses on itself 
- Historicism claims that there are no timeless facts or claims
    - all historical claims are situated in some time and place
    - this is itself a claim, and is inconsistent with its own logic

## Chapter 2: Natural Right and the Distinction between Facts and Values
- The problem of political philosophy is possible if we accept that there are "timeless" or "natural" horizon
    - but for natural right to be solvable, the problem of political philosophy must also be solvable
- Segway into is and ought
    - if political philosophy only sheds light on possible alternatives, without telling us which is the best, then it is not practical
    - modern social science -- i.e. Max Weber -- holds the view that even if there exists natural right, it is out of the reach of human reason to determine whether any one is superior to the others
- Max Weber's objection to historicism was because historicism *did not* reject natural right, but rather just situated it in historical contexts
    - Weber rejects natural right because for him, everything is individual. Natural right would assume an abstracted metaphysical phenomena that Weber rejects
    - Weber viewed science as objective. The facts of social science are also objective, but these facts are sampled from a sampling bias (values) from the sea of possible facts of social science
    - Weber's view hinges on the Is vs Ought. Strauss argues that this isn't valid because given we have an Ought, social science may be used to guide the Is. Weber's objection stems from his belief that we cannot have any genuine knowledge of Ought.
    - Strauss will argue that this sort of relativism of values leads to contradiction

# Natural Right and History

## Chapter 1: Natural Right and the Historical Approach
- Historicism collapses on itself 
- Historicism claims that there are no timeless facts or claims
    - all historical claims are situated in some time and place
    - this is itself a claim, and is inconsistent with its own logic

## Chapter 2: Natural Right and the Distinction between Facts and Values
- The problem of political philosophy is possible if we accept that there are "timeless" or "natural" horizon
    - but for natural right to be solvable, the problem of political philosophy must also be solvable
- Segway into is and ought
    - if political philosophy only sheds light on possible alternatives, without telling us which is the best, then it is not practical
    - modern social science -- i.e. Max Weber -- holds the view that even if there exists natural right, it is out of the reach of human reason to determine whether any one is superior to the others
- Max Weber's objection to historicism was because historicism *did not* reject natural right, but rather just situated it in historical contexts
    - Weber rejects natural right because for him, everything is individual. Natural right would assume an abstracted metaphysical phenomena that Weber rejects
    - Weber viewed science as objective. The facts of social science are also objective, but these facts are sampled from a sampling bias (values) from the sea of possible facts of social science
    - Weber's view hinges on the Is vs Ought. Strauss argues that this isn't valid because given we have an Ought, social science may be used to guide the Is. Weber's objection stems from his belief that we cannot have any genuine knowledge of Ought.
    - Strauss will argue that this sort of relativism of values leads to contradiction
- Natural right does not comport with Weber's method because Weber is coming at it from the world of science, while the world that precedes science would admit of the idea of natural right. 

## Chapter 3: The Origin of the Idea of Natural Right
- going back to the idea of "natural" before philosophy
- the idea of "nature" partitions up the whole of phenomenon
    - previously, there was no distinction made between mere custom and the unchanging "nature" of things
        - "Barking and wagging the tail is the way of dogs, menstruation is the way of women,"
- the most important way was "our" way, i.e. the right way for prephilosophic man. It identified the right way with the ancestral way
- "The emergence of the idea of natural right presupposes, therefore, the doubt of authority."
- But the inconsistencies between the "first things" or the various ancestral ways that are in contradiction gives rise to the question as to which is the true account, and thus gives rise to philosophy
    - first-person experience vs hearsay was only applied to the non-first things, but the traveler that has seen many different customs and traditions applies this distinction to the first things as well
    - the universal application of first-person experience and hearsay leads to the judgement of truth quantified over all man, i.e. judged on the basis of man as man, as opposed to some particular group or individual
    - "natural" distinctions arise
- philosophic quest for first things presupposes there be eternal nonchanging things
    - like a moral Higgs field 
- philosophy does not so much subvert ancestral authority as it grants utmost respect to the utmost of ancestors: nature itself
    - but this does not mean philosophy delegates all authority to nature, as that would cross into theology or other authority based studies
    - philosophy is based on reason

- questions of right lead to questions of human nature. What is good is what is in accordance with human nature etc.
    - One must go back to the origins and history of the state and "the first men", to ascertain their nature
- An argument against natural right is that different societies have different conceptions of what is right
    - but this does not mean that principles of justice are changeable, simply different societies have different notions of justice
- another arg against is that the definition is hard to pin down. How does it get defined?
    - For all practical purposes, this means that the natural right teacher will identify natural right with those notions of justice that are cherished by his own society or by his own “civilization.” By speaking of natural right, he will do nothing else than claim universal validity for the prejudices of his group. If it is asserted that, as a matter of fact, many societies agree in regard to the principles of justice, it is at least as plausible to rejoin that this agreement is due to accidental causes (such as similarity of conditions of life or mutual influence) than to say that these particular societies alone have preserved human nature intact. If it is asserted that all civilized nations agree in regard to the principles of justice, one would first have to know what is meant by “civilization.” If the natural right teacher identifies civilization with recognition of natural right or an equivalent, he says, in effect, that all men who accept the principles of natural right accept the principles of natural right. If he understands by “civilization” a high development of the arts or sciences, his contention is refuted by the fact that conventionalists are frequently civilized men; and believers in natural right or in the principles which are said to constitute the essence of natural right are frequently very little civilized.29

- but the differences in notions of justice are notable because they aren't just conventions
    - differences in convention do not cause conflict, they are just conventions. But differences in notions of justice are a problem, and aren't *just* conventions
- Strauss steelman's conventionalism
    - right is conventional because it depends on the city and the city is conventional
        - what is right to the city usually goes against what is "good" or expedient for the individual
        - what is good for the city is only good for the part of the city in power, which is also conventional
        - what counts as "good" is defined by convention
- state of nature
    - Epicurean state of nature as blissful good shit
        - but dangers lurk, so the people have to come together and thus some freedom is sacrificed for security
    - Vulgar conventionalism owes its origin to a corruption of philosophic conventionalism.
        - the Sophists have corrupted it: "Vulgar conventionalism owes its origin to a corruption of philosophic conventionalist"
        - "He is concerned with wisdom, not for its own sake, not because he hates the lie in the soul more than anything else, but for the sake of the honor or the prestige that attends wisdom."
- pre-socratic natural right: egalitarian natural right
    - "He is concerned with wisdom, not for its own sake, not because he hates the lie in the soul more than anything else, but for the sake of the honor or the prestige that attends wisdom."
    - "Thus the city appears to be against natural right, for the city stands or falls by inequality or subordination and by the restriction of freedom."
    - how to reconcile the two?: consent of the governed
        - if nature is regarded as the standard, contract theory of civil societies come with negative connotations
        - "For in the modern era the notion that nature is the standard was abandoned, and therewith the stigma on whatever is conventional or contractual was taken away. As for premodern times, it is safe to assume that all contractualist doctrines implied the depreciation of whatever owed its origin to contract"

## Chapter 4: Classic Natural Right
- Socrates
    - dialectics: from common sense, to contradictory views, to a consistent/comprehensive truth
- The classical conception of Natural Right and the good life was conceived in disagreement with Hedonism (conventionalism whereby the good is equated with the pleasurable)
- p. 132: "If restraint is as natural to man as is freedom, and restraint must in many cases be forcible restraint in order to be effective, one cannot say that the city is conventional or against nature because it is coercive society."
- p. 142: "To summarize, one may say that it is characteristic of the classic natural right teaching to culminate in a twofold answer to the question of the best regime: the simply best regime would be the absolute rule of the wise; the practically best regime is the rule, under law, of gentlemen, or the mixed regime."
- Classical understandings of Natural Right into 3 types: Platonic, Aristotelian, Thomistic
- Platonic
    - p 145: "justice is good and that justice consists in giving to everyone what is due to him."
    - p 148: "But everyone does best that for which he is best fitted by nature. Justice exists, then, only in a society in which everyone does what he can do well and in which everyone has what he can use well. Justice is identical with membership in such a society and devotion to such a society—a society according to nature."
    - but closed civil society must distinguish between friends and enemies, and the rules of conduct between them are diametrically opposed.
        - --> "world state"
- Aristotelian
    - p. 156: according to Aristotle, there is no fundamental disproportion between natural right and the requirements of political society, or there is no essential need for the dilution of natural right.
    - p 156: Plato eventually defines natural right with direct reference to the fact that the only life which is simply just is the life of the philosopher. Aristotle, on the other hand, treats each of the various levels of beings, and hence especially every level of human life, on its own terms.
    - 160: A decent society will not go to war except for a just cause. But what it will do during a war will depend to a certain extent on what the enemy—possibly an absolutely unscrupulous and savage enemy—forces it to do. There are no limits which can be defined in advance, there are no assignable limits to what might become just reprisals.
    - 160: It suffices to repeat that in extreme situations the normally valid rules of natural right are justly changed, or changed in accordance with natural right; the exceptions are as just as the rules.
    - 161: Justice has two different principles or sets of principles: the requirements of public safety, or what is necessary in extreme situations to preserve the mere existence or independence of society, on the one hand, and the rules of justice in the more precise sense, on the other. And there is no principle which defines clearly in what type of cases the public safety, and in what type of cases the precise rules of justice, have priority.
    - 162: The variability of the demands of that justice which men can practice was recognized not only by Aristotle but by Plato as well. Both avoided the Scylla of “absolutism” and the Charybdis of “relativism” by holding a view which one may venture to express as follows: There is a universally valid hierarchy of ends, but there are no universally valid rules of action.
- Thomistic
    - 157: According to Thomas Aquinas, this statement must be understood with a qualification: the principles of natural right, the axioms from which the more specific rules of natural right are derived, are universally valid and immutable; what are mutable are only the more specific rules
    - 164: At any rate, the ultimate consequence of the Thomistic view of natural law is that natural law is practically inseparable not only from natural theology—i.e., from a natural theology which is, in fact, based on belief in biblical revelation—but even from revealed theology. Modern natural law was partly a reaction to this absorption of natural law by theology.
    - 164: The modern efforts were partly based on the premise, which would have been acceptable to the classics, that the moral principles have a greater evidence than the teachings even of natural theology and, therefore, that natural law or natural right should be kept independent of theology and its controversies.

## Chapter 5: Modern Natural Right
### Hobbes
- 168: He tries to instil the spirit of political idealism into the hedonistic tradition. 
- 169: His philosophy as a whole may be said to be the classic example of the typically modern combination of political idealism with a materialistic and atheistic view of the whole.
- real knowledge must stand the assault of extreme skepticism
    - mathematics seems to be able to do this, thus Hobbes looked to develop a political philosophy in a similar vein
    - 175: For Hobbes, the natural origin of the universals or of the anticipations was a compelling reason for abandoning them in favor of artificial “intellectual tools.” There is no natural harmony between the human mind and the universe.
- 175: "Man can guarantee the actualization of wisdom, since wisdom is identical with free construction. But wisdom cannot be free construction if the universe is intelligible. Man can guarantee the actualization of wisdom, not in spite of, but because of, the fact that the universe is unintelligible. Man can be sovereign only because there is no cosmic support for his humanity. He can be sovereign only because he is absolutely a stranger in the universe. He can be sovereign only because he is forced to be sovereign. Since the universe is unintelligible and since control of nature does not require understanding of nature, there are no knowable limits to his conquest of nature. He has nothing to lose but his chains, and, for all he knows, he may have everything to gain. Still, what is certain is that man’s natural state is misery; the vision of the City of Man to be erected on the ruins of the City of God is an unsupported hope."
- 177: All intelligibility or all meaning has its ultimate root in human needs. The end, or the most compelling end posited by human desire, is the highest principle, the organizing principle. But if the human good becomes the highest principle, political science or social science becomes the most important kind of knowledge, as Aristotle had predicted.
- 177: His expectation from political philosophy is incomparably greater than the expectation of the classics.
- qua Machiavelli's realism
    - 178: He rejected classical political philosophy, and therewith the whole tradition of political philosophy in the full sense of the term, as useless: Classical political philosophy had taken its bearings by how man ought to live; the correct way of answering the question of the right order of society consists in taking one’s bearings by how men actually do live.
    - 179" Necessity rather than moral purpose determines what is in each case the sensible course of action. Therefore, civil society cannot even aspire to be simply just. All legitimacy has its root in illegitimacy; all social or moral orders have been established with the help of morally questionable means; civil society has its root not in justice but in injustice. The founder of the most renowned of all commonwealths was a fratricide. Justice in any sense is possible only after a social order has been established; justice in any sense is possible only within a man-made order.
- 180: What Hobbes attempted to do on the basis of Machiavelli’s fundamental objection to the Utopian teaching of the tradition, although in opposition to Machiavelli’s own solution, was to maintain the idea of natural law but to divorce it from the idea of man’s perfection; only if natural law can be deduced from how men actually live, from the most powerful force that actually determines all men, or most men most of the time, can it be effectual or of practical value.
- 181: The most powerful of all passions is the fear of death and, more particularly, the fear of violent death at the hands of others: not nature but “that terrible enemy of nature, death,” yet death insofar as man can do something about it, i.e., death insofar as it can be avoided or avenged, supplies the ultimate guidance.
- 181: *the desire for self-preservation is the sole root of all justice and morality, the fundamental moral fact is not a duty but a right; all duties are derivative from the fundamental and inalienable right of self-preservation.*
- 182: *course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a much greater emphasis was put on rights than ever had been done before. One may speak of a shift of emphasis from natural duties to natural rights.*
- 183: *The tradition which Hobbes opposed had assumed that man cannot reach the perfection of his nature except in and through civil society and, therefore, that civil society is prior to the individual. It was this assumption which led to the view that the primary moral fact is duty and not rights.*
- who is to be the judge of what means are required for a man’s self-preservation or as to which means are proper or right?
    - 185: The classics would have answered that the natural judge is the man of practical wisdom, and this answer would finally lead back to the view that the simply best regime is the absolute rule of the wise and the best practicable regime is the rule of gentlemen.
    - 185: For, even granting that the wise man is, in principle, a better judge, he is much less concerned with the self-preservation of a given fool than is the fool himself.
    - 186: consent takes precedence over wisdom.
    - 186: the sovereign is sovereign not because of his wisdom but because he has been made sovereign by the fundamental compact.
- 192: new type of political theory solves, as such, the crucial practical problem: the problem of what order is just here and now. In the decisive respect, then, there is no longer any need for statesmanship as distinguished from political theory. We may call this type of thinking “doctrinairism,”
- 194: The necessary coincidence of the greatest human force and the highest human authority corresponds strictly to the necessary coincidence of the most powerful passion (fear of violent death) and the most sacred right (the right of self-preservation).
    - 195: right declares what is permitted, as distinguished from what is honorable.
- 200: But if the fear of violent death is truly the strongest force in man, one should expect the desired social order always, or almost always, to be in existence, because it will be produced by natural necessity, by the natural order. Hobbes overcomes this difficulty by assuming that men in their stupidity interfere with the natural order.
- 201: Hobbes’s rationalism, then, rests ultimately on the conviction that, thanks to nature’s kindness, the strongest passion is the only passion which can be “the origin of large and lasting societies” or that the strongest passion is the most rational passion.
- 201: As long as Hobbes’s approach prevails, “the philosophy concerned with the human things” will remain the last refuge of nature. For at some point nature succeeds in getting a hearing. The modern contention that man can “change the world” or “push back nature” is not unreasonable. One can even safely go much beyond it and say that man can expel nature with a hayfork.
- It looks to me that Strauss is really quite skeptical of Hobbes' claims. Notably, Strauss probably thinks that Hobbes contradicts himself by claiming that since nature is unintelligible (i.e. reason is impotent), man can have free reign in shaping it; but then nature pushes back at some point.
Strauss also seems to cast some doubt on the Hobbes' idea of the fear of death being a sufficiently strong driver of civil society. Strauss seems to be a little sardonic when bringing up the invisible hand of the Leviathan (i.e "you mean like that of the Wealth of Nations/free market?" which is basically the opposite of the Leviathan).

### Locke
- Is Locke writing estoterically?
    - Strauss examines Locke's claim that he is drawing natural law from the New Testament
    - 219: It can safely be said, we think, that Locke’s “partial law of nature” is not identical with clear and plain teachings of the New Testament or of Scripture in general.
    - 220: In order to be a law in the proper sense of the term, the law of nature must be known to have been given by God. But the “partial law of nature” does not require belief in God. The “partial law of nature” circumscribes the conditions which a nation must fulfil in order to be civil or civilized.
    - 220: accepted interpretation of Locke’s teaching leads to the consequence that “Locke is full of illogical flaws and inconsistencies,”79 of inconsistencies, we add, which are so obvious that they cannot have escaped the notice of a man of his rank and his sobriety.
    - 221: accepted interpretation does not pay sufficient attention to the character of the Treatise; it somehow assumes that the Treatise contains the philosophic presentation of Locke’s political doctrine, whereas it contains, in fact, only its “civil” presentation. In the Treatise, it is less Locke the philosopher than Locke the Englishman who addresses not philosophers, but Englishmen.
- 222: Locke’s notion of the state of nature is inseparable from the doctrine “that in the state of nature everyone has the executive power of the law of nature.”
- 225: Since there is no habitus of moral principles, no synderesis or conscience, all knowledge of the law of nature is acquired by study: to know the law of nature, one must be “a studier of that law.”
- What, then, is the status of the law of nature in Locke’s doctrine? What is its foundation?
    - 227 pursuit of happiness is a right, it “must be allowed,” because “it cannot be hindered.”
    - 227 Since the right of nature is innate, whereas the law of nature is not, the right of nature is more fundamental than the law of nature and is the foundation of the law of nature.
- 227 Since happiness presupposes life, the desire for life takes precedence over the desire for happiness in case of conflict.
- 227 And reason—or, rather, reason applied to a subject to be specified presently—is the law of nature.
- 228 Locke concludes, just as Hobbes did, that in the state of nature everyone is the judge of what means are conducive to his self-preservation, and this leads him, as it did Hobbes, to the further conclusion that in the state of nature “any man may do what he thinks fit.”
- 228 the law of nature is nothing other than the sum of the dictates of reason in regard to men’s “mutual security” or to “the peace and safety” of mankind.
- 228 Since in the state of nature all men are judges in their own cases and since, therefore, the state of nature is characterized by constant conflict that arises from the very law of nature, the state of nature is “not to be endured”: the only remedy is government or civil society.
- 229There remains, however, at least this difference between those who strictly comply with the law of nature and those who do not, that only the former can act and speak consistently; only the former can consistently maintain that there is a fundamental difference between civil societies and gangs of robbers, a distinction to which every society and every government is forced to appeal time and again.
    -  Strauss would say that Locke's apparent presentation of the peaceful state of nature is contradicted by Locke himself. Locke, in a similar way as Hobbes, argued that civil society is needed because the state of nature sucks. But in contradistinction to Hobbes, Locke uses the right to happiness -- rather than the fear of death -- as an archimedean lever by which the rest of natural law follows. The right to happiness provides an orientation to natural law that can distinguish between civil society and a gang of robbers
- 234 Above all, since self-preservation and happiness require property, so much so that the end of civil society can be said to be the preservation of property, the protection of the propertied members of society against the demands of the indigent—or the protection of the industrious and rational against the lazy and quarrelsome—is essential to public happiness or the common good.
- 235 If everyone has the natural right to preserve himself, he necessarily has the right to everything that is necessary for his self-preservation.
- 236 Labor is the only title to property which is in accordance with natural right. “Man, by being master of himself and proprietor of his own person and the actions or labour of it, [has] in himself the great foundation of property.”108 Not society, but the individual—the individual prompted by his self-interest alone—is the originator of property.
- 240 Since there is no longer enough and as good left in common for everyone, equity would seem to demand that man’s natural right to appropriate as much as he can use should be restricted to the right to appropriate as much as he needs, lest the poor be “straitened.”
    - 240 Yet Locke teaches exactly the opposite: the right to appropriate is much more restricted in the state of nature than in civil society.
    - 241 the introduction of money has introduced “larger possessions and a right to them”; man may now “rightfully and without injury, possess more than he himself can make use of.”
    - 242 Locke does not commit the absurdity of justifying the emancipation of acquisitiveness by appealing to a nonexistent absolute right of property. He justifies the emancipation of acquisitiveness in the only way in which it can be defended: he shows that it is conducive to the common good, to public happiness or the temporal prosperity of society.
- 245 It is one thing to say that the end of government or of society is the preservation of property or the protection of the unequal acquisitive faculties; it is an entirely different thing and, as it would seem, an entirely superfluous thing to say, as Locke does, that property antedates society.
    - 245Property is created by the individual and in different degrees by different individuals. Civil society merely creates the conditions under which the individuals can pursue their productive-acquisitive activity without obstruction.
    - 246 Locke’s followers in later generations no longer believed that they needed “the phraseology of the law of nature” because they took for granted what Locke did not take for granted: Locke still thought that he had to prove that the unlimited acquisition of wealth is not unjust or morally wrong.
    - Locke was OG e/acc?
- 247 By building civil society on “the low but solid ground” of selfishness or of certain “private vices,” one will achieve much greater “public benefits” than by futilely appealing to virtue, which is by nature “unendowed.” One must take one’s bearings not by how men should live but by how they do live.
- Strauss's concluding thoughts
    - 249 Locke says in effect that the greatest happiness consists in the greatest power.
    - 249-250 In the absence of a summum bonum, man would lack completely a star and compass for his life if there were no summum malum.
    - 250 The strongest desire is the desire for self-preservation. The evil from which the strongest desire recoils is death. Death must then be the greatest evil: Not the natural sweetness of living but the terrors of death make us cling to life.
    - 250 What nature firmly establishes is that from which desire moves away, the point of departure of desire; the goal toward which desire moves is secondary.
    - 250 The goal of desire is defined by nature only negatively—the denial of pain.
    - 250 It is this pain, and hence a defect, which gives man originally the most important of all rights: sufferings and defects, rather than merits or virtues, originate rights.
    - 250-251 The starting point of human efforts is misery: the state of nature is a state of wretchedness. The way toward happiness is a movement away from the state of nature, a movement away from nature: the negation of nature is the way toward happiness.
    - 251 Since there are therefore no pure pleasures, there is no necessary tension between civil society as the mighty leviathan or coercive society, on the one hand, and the good life, on the other: hedonism becomes utilitarianism or political hedonism.
    - 251 The painful relief of pain culminates not so much in the greatest pleasures as “in the having those things which produce the greatest pleasures.” Life is the joyless quest for joy.
    - Strauss appears to be critiquing Locke's (and Hobbes') departure from teleological foundations of civil society. Furthermore, the only grounding appears to be that of the state of nature as wretched (negative) and thus the (directionless) aim away from pain and negativity is what drives Locke's citizens. Since there are no pure pleasures, this would also mean the Lockean citizen may not distinguish between a Lockean democracy and a coercive tyranny. Finally, Locke's emphasis on property leads the pleasure-maximizer into the unpleasurable pursuit (labor is not pleasurable in Locke's framework) of maximum means of pleasure.
- thought left unsaid, it seems to me that Strauss would think that Locke is basically a less autistic Hobbes. Locke and Hobbes share a lot of the same points, Locke just presents it better (especially to the people of his time)

## Chapter VI: The Crisis of Modern Natural Right
### Rousseau
- 254 There is an obvious tension between the return to the city and the return to the state of nature.
    - 255 he cannot have regarded his solution to the problem of the conflict between the individual and society as more than a tolerable approximation to a solution—an approximation which remains open to legitimate doubts.
    - 255 The question is, then, not how he solved the conflict between the individual and society but rather how he conceived of that insoluble conflict.
- 257 According to Rousseau, civil society is essentially a particular or, more precisely, a closed society.
    - “the philosophy of each people is little apt for another people.”
    - On the other hand, science or philosophy is essentially universal.
- 257 Furthermore, society requires that its members be fully devoted to the common good or that they be busy or active on behalf of their fellows: “Every idle citizen is a scoundrel.”
- 259 It was by means of science or philosophy that Rousseau established the thesis that science or philosophy is incompatible with free society and hence with virtue. In so doing, he tacitly admitted that science or philosophy can be salutary, i.e., compatible with virtue.
    - 3 arguments for resolving this apparent contradiction
    - 1) 259 According to the first suggestion, science is bad for a good society and good for a bad society.
        - but Rousseau did not address only his contemporaries, but also a good society, therefore philosophy is also essential to a good society
    - 2) 260 According to Rousseau’s second suggestion, science is good for “the individuals,” i.e., for “some great geniuses” or “some privileged souls” or “the small number of true philosophers,” among whom he counts himself, but bad for “the peoples” or “the public” or “the common men” (les hommes vulgaires). 
        - 260 The diffusion of scientific knowledge is disastrous not only for society but for science or philosophy itself; through popularization, science degenerates into opinion, or the fight against prejudice becomes itself a prejudice. Science must remain the preserve of a small minority; it must be kept secret from the common man.
        - is this why Strauss writes esoterically?
    - 3) 262 The third suggestion solves the contradiction by distinguishing between two kinds of science: a kind of science which is incompatible with virtue and which one may call “metaphysics” (or purely theoretical science) and a kind of science which is compatible with virtue and which one may call “Socratic wisdom.”
        - 263 Theoretical science, which is not intrinsically in the service of virtue and is therefore bad, must be put into the service of virtue in order to become good.
- 263 In the name of nature, Rousseau questioned not only philosophy but the city and virtue as well. He was forced to do so because his Socratic wisdom is ultimately based on theoretical science or, rather on a particular kind of theoretical science, namely, modern natural science.
- 265 Accepting the view that brutes are machines, he suggests that there is only a difference of degree between men and the brutes in regard to understanding or that the laws of mechanics explain the formation of ideas. It is man’s power to choose and his consciousness of this freedom which cannot be explained physically and which proves the spirituality of his soul.
    - meant to be "scientific" and acceptable to materialists
    - 265 Rousseau accepts Hobbes' assumptions and agrees that one must reason Natural Right from the nature of humans 
    - 266 Rousseau expresses his loyalty to the spirit of Hobbes’s reform of the natural law teaching by substituting for “that sublime maxim of reasoned justice ‘Do unto others as you would have them to do unto you’ . . . this much less perfect, but perhaps more useful maxim ‘Do good to yourself with as little evil as possible to others.’
    - 267 he accepts Hobbes’s reduction of virtue to social virtue.
    - Disagrees with Hobbes by agreeing with Hobbes
        - 1) 268 Rousseau deviates from Hobbes because he accepts Hobbes’s premise; Hobbes is grossly inconsistent because, on the one hand, he denies that man is by nature social and, on the other hand, he tries to establish the character of natural man by referring to his experience of men which is the experience of social man.
            - man is by nature solitary
        - 2) 269 Rousseau draws the conclusion that, since Hobbes’s criticism of the traditional view is sound, one must question Hobbes’s conception of the laws of nature: not-only the right of nature but the laws of nature or man’s natural duties or his social virtues must be rooted directly in passion; they must have a much more powerful support than reasoning or calculation.
            - Hobbes was correct that laws of nature must be rooted in passion, but then proceeds to reason them...
    - 270 He concludes that man is by nature good because he is by nature swayed by self-love and compassion and free from vanity or pride.
    - 270 Since language is not natural, reason is not natural. From this we can understand best why Rousseau replaces the traditional definition of man as a rational animal by a new definition.
    - 271 Natural man is premoral in every respect: he has no heart. Natural man is subhuman.
        - 271 Man is by nature almost infinitely perfectible. There are no natural obstacles to man’s almost unlimited progress or to his power of liberating himself from evil. For the same reason, there are no natural obstacles to man’s almost unlimited degradation.
- 272 man’s leaving the state of nature, his embarking on the venture of civilization, is due not to a good or a bad use of his freedom or to essential necessity but to mechanical causation or to a series of natural accidents.
    - 272 Man’s humanity or rationality is acquired. Reason comes later than the elementary wants of the body. Reason emerges in the process of satisfying these wants. Originally, these simple and uniform wants are easily satisfied. But this very fact leads to an enormous increase in population and thus renders difficult the satisfaction of the elementary wants. Man is therefore forced to think—to learn to think—in order to survive.
    - 273 Yet all this misery and all these blunders were necessary; they were the necessary outcome of early man’s lack of experience and lack of philosophy.
    - 273 Man, the product of blind fate, eventually becomes the seeing master of his fate. Reason’s creativity or mastership over the blind forces of nature is a product of those blind forces.
- 274 If the state of nature is subhuman, it is absurd to go back to the state of nature in order to find in it the norm for man.
- 274 He realized that to the extent to which the historical process is accidental, it cannot supply man with a standard, and that, if that process has a hidden purpose, its purposefulness cannot be recognized except if there are trans-historical standards. The historical process cannot be recognized as progressive without previous knowledge of the end or purpose of the process.
- 274 It is, then, not knowledge of the historical process but knowledge of the true public right which supplies man with the true standard.
- 275 In the academic teaching of his time, the state of nature was understood not as the condition in which man had actually lived in the beginning but as a mere “supposition”: man in the state of nature is man with all his essential faculties duly developed but “considered” as subject only to the natural law, and therefore as the bearer of all those duties and rights and of only those duties and rights which derive from natural law; whether man actually ever lived in such a state in which he was not subject to any positive law is irrelevant.
    - At the beginning of the Social Contract he seems to say that knowledge of the “historical” state of nature is irrelevant for the knowledge of natural right.
- 276 His conception of the state of nature points toward a natural right teaching which is no longer based on considerations of man’s nature, or it points toward a law of reason which is no longer understood as a law of nature.
Rousseau as freedom man
- 278 in the case of conflict between freedom and self-preservation, self-preservation takes precedence. According to Rousseau, however, freedom is a higher good than life.
- 281 The ultimate outcome of this attempt was the substitution of freedom for virtue or the view that it is not virtue which makes man free but freedom which makes man virtuous.
    - Epicureanism = the individual is free form social bonds, good identical to the pleasant, but there is a natural limit to pleasure
    - Hobbes liberated man from those natural limits, but also the natural ends. Transforming duty to rights
    - Rousseau felt that rationality is not enough to produce morality. And in some kind of Hegelian synthesis: "He attempted to graft the notion of unconditional duties and of nonmercenary virtue onto the Hobbesian notion of the primacy of freedom or of rights." (280)
        - self-preservation was insufficient, as it only produces conditional duties: "If morality or humanity were to be understood adequately, they had to be traced to a right or a freedom which is radically and specifically human. Hobbes" (280)
- For Hobbes and Locke state of nature == bad, good is the opposite way but
    - 282 Rousseau’s answer to the question of the good life takes on this form: the good life consists in the closest approximation to the state of nature which is possible on the level of humanity.
    - self-preservation is tempered by compassion
    - 283 Compassion was weakened because of the emergence of vanity or pride
        - like "The Fall" from Eden?
- conflict arises when resources become scarce
    - 285 These conflicting demands are reconciled, as far as they can be reconciled, if those public judgments which issue in executive action conform strictly with law, if those public judgments which are laws are the work of the citizen body, and if every adult male who is subject to the laws can have influenced their content through his vote.
    - 285 The citizen is indeed less free than man in the state of nature, since he cannot follow his unqualified private judgment, but he is freer than man in the state of nature, since he is habitually protected by his fellows.
    - 286 Freedom in society is possible only by virtue of the complete surrender of everyone (and in particular of the government) to the will of a free society.
    - 286 The general will or the will of the people never errs in so far as it always wills the good of the people, but the people do not always see the good of the people.
    - 287 The solution of this twofold problem is supplied by the legislator, or the father of a nation, i.e., by a man of superior intelligence, who, by ascribing divine origin to a code which he has devised or by honoring the gods with his own wisdom, both convinces the people of the goodness of the laws which he submits to its vote and transforms the individual from a natural being into a citizen.
    - 287 For society can be healthy only if the opinions and sentiments engendered by society overcome and, as it were, annihilate the natural sentiments. That is to say, society must do everything possible to render the citizens oblivious of the very facts that political philosophy brings to the center of their attention as the foundations of society.
    - 289 Precisely a free society cannot exist if he who doubts the fundamental dogma of the civil religion does not outwardly conform.
- civil society is bad for the whole but good for certain kinds of individuals -- artists (not philosophers), who attain a heightened felicity from withdrawing to and living on the fringes of society
- 293 The notion that the good life consists in the return on the level of humanity to the state of nature, i.e., to a state which completely lacks all human traits, necessarily leads to the consequence that the individual claims such an ultimate freedom from society as lacks any definite human content. But this fundamental defect of the state of nature as the goal of human aspiration was in Rousseau’s eyes its perfect justification: the very indefiniteness of the state of nature as a goal of human aspiration made that state the ideal vehicle of freedom.
- 294 Every freedom which is freedom for something, every freedom which is justified by reference to something higher than the individual or than man as mere man, necessarily restricts freedom or, which is the same thing, establishes a tenable distinction between freedom and license. It makes freedom conditional on the purpose for which it is claimed.


- Rousseau's main disagreement with Hobbes was Hobbes' use of reason and assumption that natural man had reason at their disposal

### Burke
- 297 But happiness can be found only by virtue, by the restraints “which are imposed by the virtues upon the passions."
- 298 Political power or participation in political power does not belong to the rights of man, because men have a right to good government, and there is no necessary connection between good government and government by the many; the rights of man, properly understood, point toward the predominance of the “true natural aristocracy” and therewith to the predominance of property and especially landed property.
- 299 Since the function of civil society is the satisfaction of wants, the established constitution derives its authority less from the original convention or from its origin than from its beneficent working through many generations or from its fruits.
- 299 “The temporary possessors and life-renters” in the commonwealth, “unmindful of what they have received from their ancestors,” inevitably become unmindful “of what is due to their posterity.”
- 304 one must start from the fact that what appeared to the generations after Burke as a turn to History, not to say as the discovery of History, was primarily a return to the traditional view of the essential limitations of theory as distinguished from practice or prudence.
- 305 The concern with the universal or the general is likely to create a kind of blindness in regard to the particular and the unique.
- 305 Political rules derived from experience express the lessons drawn from what has succeeded or failed down to the present. They are therefore inapplicable to new situations.
- 307 Practical wisdom, in contradistinction to theory, requires, therefore, “the most delicate and complicated skill,” a skill which arises only from long and varied practice.
- 311 Society rests, indeed, on consent. Yet the consent cannot be achieved by reasoning alone, and in particular not by the mere calculation of the advantages of living together—a calculation which may be completed in a brief span of time—but solely by habits and prejudices which grow up only in long periods. Whereas theory rejects error, prejudice, or superstition, the statesman puts these to use.
- 311 The intrusion of theory into politics is liable to have an unsettling and inflaming effect. No actual social order is perfect. “Speculative inquiries” necessarily bring to light the imperfect character of the established order. If these inquiries are introduced into political discussion, which, of necessity, lacks “the coolness of philosophic inquiry,” they are liable “to raise discontent in the people” in regard to the established order, discontent which may make rational reform impossible.
- 311 He parts company with the Aristotelian tradition by disparaging theory and especially metaphysics.
- 312 Our knowledge of bodily and mental phenomena is limited to the manner of their operation, to their How; it can never reach their Why. The very title of the inquiry reveals the ancestry of Burke’s sole theoretic effort; it is reminiscent of Locke and of Burke’s acquaintance, Hume.
- 313 he rejects the view that constitutions can be “made” in favor of the view that they must “grow”; he therefore rejects in particular the view that the best social order can be or ought to be the work of an individual, of a wise “legislator” or founder.
- 314 What came to be called “historical” was, for Burke, still “the local and accidental.” What came to be called “historical process” was for him still accidental causation or accidental causation modified by the prudential handling of situations as they arose. Accordingly, the sound political order for him, in the last analysis, is the unintended outcome of accidental causation.
- 315 The good order or the rational is the result of forces which do not themselves tend toward the good order or the rational.
- 315 This view, of which the classic exposition is to be found in Rousseau’s Second Discourse, led to the consequence that “the historical process” was thought to culminate in an absolute moment: the moment in which man, the product of blind fate, becomes the seeing master of his fate by understanding for the first time in an adequate manner what is right and wrong politically and morally.
- 315 Burke denies the possibility of an absolute moment; man can never become the seeing master of his fate; what the wisest individual can think out for himself is always inferior to what has been produced “in a great length of time, and by a great variety of accidents.”
- 316 What is needed is not “metaphysical jurisprudence” but “historical jurisprudence.” 101 Thus Burke paves the way for “the historical school.”
- 318 Burke comes close to suggesting that to oppose a thoroughly evil current in human affairs is perverse if that current is sufficiently powerful; he is oblivious of the nobility of last-ditch resistance. He does not consider that, in a way which no man can foresee, resistance in a forlorn position to the enemies of mankind, “going down with guns blazing and flag flying,” may contribute greatly toward keeping awake the recollection of the immense loss sustained by mankind, may inspire and strengthen the desire and the hope for its recovery, and may become a beacon for those who humbly carry on the works of humanity in a seemingly endless valley of darkness and destruction.
- 318 Whereas Burke’s “conservatism” is in full agreement with classical thought, his interpretation of his “conservatism” prepared an approach to human affairs which is even more foreign to classical thought than was the very “radicalism” of the theorists of the French Revolution. Political philosophy or political theory had been from its inception the quest for civil society as it ought to be. Burke’s political theory is, or tends to become, identical with a theory of the British constitution, i.e., an attempt to “discover the latent wisdom which prevails” in the actual.
- 319 Transcendent standards can be dispensed with if the standard is inherent in the process; “the actual and the present is the rational.” What could appear as a return to the primeval equation of the good with the ancestral is, in fact, a preparation for Hegel.
- 319 We have noted before that what appeared later on as the discovery of History was originally rather the recovery of the distinction between theory and practice. That distinction had been blurred by the doctrinairism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries or, what is fundamentally the same thing, by the understanding of all theory as essentially in the service of practice (scientia propter potentiam). The recovery of the distinction between theory and practice was from the outset modified by skepticism in regard to theoretical metaphysics, a skepticism which culminated in the depreciation of theory in favor of practice. In accordance with these antecedents, the highest form of practice—the foundation or formation of a political society—was viewed as a quasi-natural process not controlled by reflection; thus it could become a purely theoretical theme. Political theory became understanding of what practice has produced or of the actual and ceased to be the quest for what ought to be; political theory ceased to be “theoretically practical” (i.e., deliberative at a second remove) and became purely theoretical in the way in which metaphysics (and physics) were traditionally understood to be purely theoretical. There came into being a new type of theory, of metaphysics, having as its highest theme human action and its product rather than the whole, which is in no way the object of human action. Within the whole and the metaphysic that is oriented upon it, human action occupies a high but subordinate place. When metaphysics came, as it now did, to regard human action and its product as the end toward which all other beings or processes are directed, metaphysics became philosophy of history. Philosophy of history was primarily theory, i.e., contemplation, of human practice and therewith necessarily of completed human practice; it presupposed that significant human action, History, was completed. By becoming the highest theme of philosophy, practice ceased to be practice proper, i.e., concern with agenda. The revolts against Hegelianism on the part of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, in so far as they now exercise a strong influence on public opinion, thus appear as attempts to recover the possibility of practice, i.e., of a human life which has a significant and undetermined future. But these attempts increased the confusion, since they destroyed, as far as in them lay, the very possibility of theory. “Doctrinairism” and “existentialism” appear to us as the two faulty extremes. While being opposed to each other, they agree with each other in the decisive respect—they agree in ignoring prudence, “the god of this lower world.” 105 Prudence and “this lower world” cannot be seen properly without some knowledge of “the higher world”—without genuine theoria.
- 322 Burke disagreed with the classics in regard to the genesis of the sound social order because he disagreed with them in regard to the character of the sound social order. As he saw it, the sound social or political order must not be “formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of design” because such “systematical” proceedings, such “presumption in the wisdom of human contrivances,” would be incompatible with the highest possible degree of “personal liberty”; the state must pursue “the greatest variety of ends” and must as little as possible “sacrifice any one of them to another, or to the whole.” It must be concerned with “individuality” or have the highest possible regard for “individual feeling and individual interest.”
- 323 The quarrel between the ancients and the moderns concerns eventually, and perhaps even from the beginning, the status of “individuality.” Burke himself was still too deeply imbued with the spirit of “sound antiquity” to allow the concern with individuality to overpower the concern with virtue.

- Burke wouldn't be a transition between the ancient and modern, that would be Hobbes and Locke. Burke would be an attempt at going back to the ancient tradition. But there is always the question of whether that is possible. Is it possible to go back to Natural Right as virtue and duty if the concept of Natural Right as a *right* (as along the lines of the pursuit of happiness) has been discovered and unleashed? Can it be put back into the bottle?

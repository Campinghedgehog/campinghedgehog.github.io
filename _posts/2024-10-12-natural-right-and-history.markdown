# Natural Right and History

## Chapter 1: Natural Right and the Historical Approach
- Historicism collapses on itself 
- Historicism claims that there are no timeless facts or claims
    - all historical claims are situated in some time and place
    - this is itself a claim, and is inconsistent with its own logic

## Chapter 2: Natural Right and the Distinction between Facts and Values
- The problem of political philosophy is possible if we accept that there are "timeless" or "natural" horizon
    - but for natural right to be solvable, the problem of political philosophy must also be solvable
- Segway into is and ought
    - if political philosophy only sheds light on possible alternatives, without telling us which is the best, then it is not practical
    - modern social science -- i.e. Max Weber -- holds the view that even if there exists natural right, it is out of the reach of human reason to determine whether any one is superior to the others
- Max Weber's objection to historicism was because historicism *did not* reject natural right, but rather just situated it in historical contexts
    - Weber rejects natural right because for him, everything is individual. Natural right would assume an abstracted metaphysical phenomena that Weber rejects
    - Weber viewed science as objective. The facts of social science are also objective, but these facts are sampled from a sampling bias (values) from the sea of possible facts of social science
    - Weber's view hinges on the Is vs Ought. Strauss argues that this isn't valid because given we have an Ought, social science may be used to guide the Is. Weber's objection stems from his belief that we cannot have any genuine knowledge of Ought.
    - Strauss will argue that this sort of relativism of values leads to contradiction
- Natural right does not comport with Weber's method because Weber is coming at it from the world of science, while the world that precedes science would admit of the idea of natural right. 

## Chapter 3: The Origin of the Idea of Natural Right
- going back to the idea of "natural" before philosophy
- the idea of "nature" partitions up the whole of phenomenon
    - previously, there was no distinction made between mere custom and the unchanging "nature" of things
        - "Barking and wagging the tail is the way of dogs, menstruation is the way of women,"
- the most important way was "our" way, i.e. the right way for prephilosophic man. It identified the right way with the ancestral way
- "The emergence of the idea of natural right presupposes, therefore, the doubt of authority."
- But the inconsistencies between the "first things" or the various ancestral ways that are in contradiction gives rise to the question as to which is the true account, and thus gives rise to philosophy
    - first-person experience vs hearsay was only applied to the non-first things, but the traveler that has seen many different customs and traditions applies this distinction to the first things as well
    - the universal application of first-person experience and hearsay leads to the judgement of truth quantified over all man, i.e. judged on the basis of man as man, as opposed to some particular group or individual
    - "natural" distinctions arise

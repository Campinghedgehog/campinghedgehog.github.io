# Natural Right and History

## Chapter 1: Natural Right and the Historical Approach
- Historicism collapses on itself 
- Historicism claims that there are no timeless facts or claims
    - all historical claims are situated in some time and place
    - this is itself a claim, and is inconsistent with its own logic

## Chapter 2: Natural Right and the Distinction between Facts and Values
- The problem of political philosophy is possible if we accept that there are "timeless" or "natural" horizon
    - but for natural right to be solvable, the problem of political philosophy must also be solvable
- Segway into is and ought
    - if political philosophy only sheds light on possible alternatives, without telling us which is the best, then it is not practical
    - modern social science -- i.e. Max Weber -- holds the view that even if there exists natural right, it is out of the reach of human reason to determine whether any one is superior to the others
- Max Weber's objection to historicism was because historicism *did not* reject natural right, but rather just situated it in historical contexts
    - Weber rejects natural right because for him, everything is individual. Natural right would assume an abstracted metaphysical phenomena that Weber rejects
    - Weber viewed science as objective. The facts of social science are also objective, but these facts are sampled from a sampling bias (values) from the sea of possible facts of social science
    - Weber's view hinges on the Is vs Ought. Strauss argues that this isn't valid because given we have an Ought, social science may be used to guide the Is. Weber's objection stems from his belief that we cannot have any genuine knowledge of Ought.
    - Strauss will argue that this sort of relativism of values leads to contradiction
- Natural right does not comport with Weber's method because Weber is coming at it from the world of science, while the world that precedes science would admit of the idea of natural right. 

## Chapter 3: The Origin of the Idea of Natural Right
- going back to the idea of "natural" before philosophy
- the idea of "nature" partitions up the whole of phenomenon
    - previously, there was no distinction made between mere custom and the unchanging "nature" of things
        - "Barking and wagging the tail is the way of dogs, menstruation is the way of women,"
- the most important way was "our" way, i.e. the right way for prephilosophic man. It identified the right way with the ancestral way
- "The emergence of the idea of natural right presupposes, therefore, the doubt of authority."
- But the inconsistencies between the "first things" or the various ancestral ways that are in contradiction gives rise to the question as to which is the true account, and thus gives rise to philosophy
    - first-person experience vs hearsay was only applied to the non-first things, but the traveler that has seen many different customs and traditions applies this distinction to the first things as well
    - the universal application of first-person experience and hearsay leads to the judgement of truth quantified over all man, i.e. judged on the basis of man as man, as opposed to some particular group or individual
    - "natural" distinctions arise
- philosophic quest for first things presupposes there be eternal nonchanging things
    - like a moral Higgs field 
- philosophy does not so much subvert ancestral authority as it grants utmost respect to the utmost of ancestors: nature itself
    - but this does not mean philosophy delegates all authority to nature, as that would cross into theology or other authority based studies
    - philosophy is based on reason

- questions of right lead to questions of human nature. What is good is what is in accordance with human nature etc.
    - One must go back to the origins and history of the state and "the first men", to ascertain their nature
- An argument against natural right is that different societies have different conceptions of what is right
    - but this does not mean that principles of justice are changeable, simply different societies have different notions of justice
- another arg against is that the definition is hard to pin down. How does it get defined?
    - For all practical purposes, this means that the natural right teacher will identify natural right with those notions of justice that are cherished by his own society or by his own “civilization.” By speaking of natural right, he will do nothing else than claim universal validity for the prejudices of his group. If it is asserted that, as a matter of fact, many societies agree in regard to the principles of justice, it is at least as plausible to rejoin that this agreement is due to accidental causes (such as similarity of conditions of life or mutual influence) than to say that these particular societies alone have preserved human nature intact. If it is asserted that all civilized nations agree in regard to the principles of justice, one would first have to know what is meant by “civilization.” If the natural right teacher identifies civilization with recognition of natural right or an equivalent, he says, in effect, that all men who accept the principles of natural right accept the principles of natural right. If he understands by “civilization” a high development of the arts or sciences, his contention is refuted by the fact that conventionalists are frequently civilized men; and believers in natural right or in the principles which are said to constitute the essence of natural right are frequently very little civilized.29

- but the differences in notions of justice are notable because they aren't just conventions
    - differences in convention do not cause conflict, they are just conventions. But differences in notions of justice are a problem, and aren't *just* conventions
- Strauss steelman's conventionalism
    - right is conventional because it depends on the city and the city is conventional
        - what is right to the city usually goes against what is "good" or expedient for the individual
        - what is good for the city is only good for the part of the city in power, which is also conventional
        - what counts as "good" is defined by convention
- state of nature
    - Epicurean state of nature as blissful good shit
        - but dangers lurk, so the people have to come together and thus some freedom is sacrificed for security
    - Vulgar conventionalism owes its origin to a corruption of philosophic conventionalism.
        - the Sophists have corrupted it: "Vulgar conventionalism owes its origin to a corruption of philosophic conventionalist"
        - "He is concerned with wisdom, not for its own sake, not because he hates the lie in the soul more than anything else, but for the sake of the honor or the prestige that attends wisdom."
- pre-socratic natural right: egalitarian natural right
    - "He is concerned with wisdom, not for its own sake, not because he hates the lie in the soul more than anything else, but for the sake of the honor or the prestige that attends wisdom."
    - "Thus the city appears to be against natural right, for the city stands or falls by inequality or subordination and by the restriction of freedom."
    - how to reconcile the two?: consent of the governed
        - if nature is regarded as the standard, contract theory of civil societies come with negative connotations
        - "For in the modern era the notion that nature is the standard was abandoned, and therewith the stigma on whatever is conventional or contractual was taken away. As for premodern times, it is safe to assume that all contractualist doctrines implied the depreciation of whatever owed its origin to contract"

## Chapter 4: Classic Natural Right
- Socrates
    - dialectics: from common sense, to contradictory views, to a consistent/comprehensive truth
- The classical conception of Natural Right and the good life was conceived in disagreement with Hedonism (conventionalism whereby the good is equated with the pleasurable)
- p. 132: "If restraint is as natural to man as is freedom, and restraint must in many cases be forcible restraint in order to be effective, one cannot say that the city is conventional or against nature because it is coercive society."
- p. 142: "To summarize, one may say that it is characteristic of the classic natural right teaching to culminate in a twofold answer to the question of the best regime: the simply best regime would be the absolute rule of the wise; the practically best regime is the rule, under law, of gentlemen, or the mixed regime."
- Classical understandings of Natural Right into 3 types: Platonic, Aristotelian, Thomistic
- Platonic
    - p 145: "justice is good and that justice consists in giving to everyone what is due to him."
    - p 148: "But everyone does best that for which he is best fitted by nature. Justice exists, then, only in a society in which everyone does what he can do well and in which everyone has what he can use well. Justice is identical with membership in such a society and devotion to such a society—a society according to nature."
    - but closed civil society must distinguish between friends and enemies, and the rules of conduct between them are diametrically opposed.
        - --> "world state"
- Aristotelian
    - p. 156: according to Aristotle, there is no fundamental disproportion between natural right and the requirements of political society, or there is no essential need for the dilution of natural right.
    - p 156: Plato eventually defines natural right with direct reference to the fact that the only life which is simply just is the life of the philosopher. Aristotle, on the other hand, treats each of the various levels of beings, and hence especially every level of human life, on its own terms.
    - 160: A decent society will not go to war except for a just cause. But what it will do during a war will depend to a certain extent on what the enemy—possibly an absolutely unscrupulous and savage enemy—forces it to do. There are no limits which can be defined in advance, there are no assignable limits to what might become just reprisals.
    - 160: It suffices to repeat that in extreme situations the normally valid rules of natural right are justly changed, or changed in accordance with natural right; the exceptions are as just as the rules.
    - 161: Justice has two different principles or sets of principles: the requirements of public safety, or what is necessary in extreme situations to preserve the mere existence or independence of society, on the one hand, and the rules of justice in the more precise sense, on the other. And there is no principle which defines clearly in what type of cases the public safety, and in what type of cases the precise rules of justice, have priority.
    - 162: The variability of the demands of that justice which men can practice was recognized not only by Aristotle but by Plato as well. Both avoided the Scylla of “absolutism” and the Charybdis of “relativism” by holding a view which one may venture to express as follows: There is a universally valid hierarchy of ends, but there are no universally valid rules of action.
- Thomistic
    - 157: According to Thomas Aquinas, this statement must be understood with a qualification: the principles of natural right, the axioms from which the more specific rules of natural right are derived, are universally valid and immutable; what are mutable are only the more specific rules
    - 164: At any rate, the ultimate consequence of the Thomistic view of natural law is that natural law is practically inseparable not only from natural theology—i.e., from a natural theology which is, in fact, based on belief in biblical revelation—but even from revealed theology. Modern natural law was partly a reaction to this absorption of natural law by theology.
    - 164: The modern efforts were partly based on the premise, which would have been acceptable to the classics, that the moral principles have a greater evidence than the teachings even of natural theology and, therefore, that natural law or natural right should be kept independent of theology and its controversies.

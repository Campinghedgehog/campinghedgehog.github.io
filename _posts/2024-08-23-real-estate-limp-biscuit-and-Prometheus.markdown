Work in progress
[Updated August 23, 2024]

# The Greeks
## Prometheus
## Back to Plato
### Eros
### Thymos

### A note on Nietzsche
As both mentioning Nietzsche, and distinctly not mentioning Nietzsche both draw attention to Nietzsche, I must take a brief moment to mention Nietzsche. I've only read _Genealogy_ and _Beyond Good and Evil_. I liked his genealogical approach. And if I remember correctly, _Beyond Good and Evil_ was basically that: some people are better than others. I'm neither a Nietzschean nor an anti-Nietzschean. But Nietzsche exists and, like dijon in a hamburger, may tend to overpower one's frame. So this is a somewhat feeble attempt to preempt that. Okay, moving on.

# The Austrians
List, Mises

# [The Greeks](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/){:target="_blank"} (reprise)

# Not even Faustian
at least, in tragedy, the stakes are high

<!-- And because I do not like cum, and only kind of like [wheat thins](https://youtube.com/shorts/No0aQPNDr58?feature=shared){:target="_blank"}, I must at this time decline the bargain. -->

# Mythos and language
<!-- Form brotherhood. Fight dragons. Find God. -->

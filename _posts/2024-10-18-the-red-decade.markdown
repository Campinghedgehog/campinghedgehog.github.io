The following paragraph is a short summary of the author, Eugene Lyons, copied from [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai):  
> Eugene Lyons, born Yevgeny Natanovich Privin in 1898 in Russia, was raised in a politically active Jewish family that immigrated to the United States in 1907. His early exposure to socialist ideas shaped his identity; he attended a Socialist Sunday School and became a member of the Young People's Socialist League. Lyons worked as a journalist for leftist publications and was initially supportive of the Soviet Union, viewing it as an experiment in socialism. However, after spending several years as a foreign correspondent in Moscow from 1928 to 1934, he became increasingly critical of the regime, ultimately denouncing the brutal realities of Stalinism in his writings, particularly in his book *Assignment in Utopia* published in 1937.[^0]

And more boilerplate:  
> Eugene Lyons' *The Red Decade: The Stalinist Penetration of America*, published in 1941, offers a contemporaneous critique of the growing influence of Communism in the United States during the 1930s. Drawing from his firsthand experiences with Soviet politics, Lyons argues that many American liberals were seduced by Communist ideology, viewing it as a progressive alternative amidst the economic despair of the Great Depression. He describes these individuals as part of an "Innocents Club," showcasing their idealism and naivety regarding the oppressive realities of Stalinism. Through detailed analysis, Lyons highlights how prominent cultural figures and intellectuals supported Communist narratives, often at the expense of independent thought and moral clarity.[^0]

Besides titillating the cosmopolitan sensibilities, Stalinism in America also subsisted on patronage networks. Those that were favored by the Communist Party USA were the ones favored by Stalin, and Stalin favored those without any talent except that of following the party line. Those who could not compete on merit competed on obedience, and Stalinism provided just that opportunity. And thus American Stalinism consisted of prestige fueling the american elite and patronage leading the american not-so-elite. 

But *The Red Decade* was not really about Stalinism -- that is merely incidental. What Lyons really documented was the American cosmopolitan ethos, and its susceptibility to overindulge the [thymos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumos), something that is not unique to Stalinism.

Lyons also describes the methods by which following the party line was enforced in America, some examples of which are quoted below. What is clear is that "cancellation" is not a modern phenomenon. Nor is "woke", or "ideological college kids". This was almost 100 years ago.

This is not to say that all that is rooted in Stalinism. That would be getting the cause and effect mixed up. It is a long-standing bug (or feature?) of the American, and now global minus Russia and China, elite. And the elite are not bad people. Quite to the contrary, they are usually more productive, healthier, smarter, more cultured, and overall just better people. How else does prestige come about?

Failure to recognize such a feature in the American elite leads to some rather comical attempts at addressing the problem. I won't list examples here, but almost certainly they do not address the heart of the problem, are much too insignificant, and will fizzle out and die. 

Once again, *The Red Decade* was published in 1941. 

The following are passages I found interesting, presented without further comment:

> They were going through an ecstatic semi-religious experience. But not one of them gave up his stocks and bonds, his capitalist job, his lucrative pulpit, his last yacht. Few of them went so far as to join the party and accept the bonds of discipline. They preferred to be voluntary totalitarians. It was a faith which, being in large part a political racket, cynically and often contemptuously permitted them the thrill of “belonging” without the inconvenience of living up to its precepts. They could make their sacrifices comfortably by overeating at banquets and over drinking at cocktail parties for the cause. They starved too-but vicariously, in the persons of Russian workers and peasants.[^2]

> For the managers of the enterprise, however, life was not as smooth as this recital might imply. They worked under the stern and jaundiced eye of a cantankerous master. The New Masses brain trust might dress down the reviewers of the capitalist press here and tell off best-selling novelists with a few rough epithets, but they pleaded for mercy each time they were notified by Moscow that they had once again exhibited “a whole series of serious defects.” In the proletarian homeland such “serious defects” were punished by exile or worse. That type of literary criticism could not as yet be enforced in America.[^3]

> Previous communist reversals of policy had involved, for Moscow’s faithful, certain physical discomforts and hazards, even a measure of social ostracism. There are people with an esoteric taste for martyrdom. The sense of standing alone against the world, of being hunted by the law but beloved of God ( or in this case, History), has its psychological compensations. But the number of men and women with such specialized tastes is in the nature of the matter limited. The present reversal, on the contrary, offered release from risks and a chance to “belong,” It offered the sweets of respectability and the comforts of conformity. After all, it is easier to go to bourgeois cocktail parties than to jail. In America the Trojan Horse tactics meant identification with the main trends in the national government, with the vaporous surge of a strange new liberalism.[^6]

> It became increasingly “smart” to be red, now that red had lost most of its former political off-color connotations. Where the incredible revolution was most pervasive-in New York, Washington, Hollywood, certain college campuses, certain intellectual and social strata-one either conformed or remained outside the main trends. A species of intellectual ostracism was the price of rebellion against the pressure groups. Tens of thousands “belonged” automatically-they never joined; it simply caught up with them and saturated their lives. For hundreds of college professors, New Deal officials, book reviewers, columnists, liberal divines and undifferentiated liberals, show of resistance would have meant virtual isolation from their friends and families and associates.[^7]

> Only the genuine radicals-socialists, libertarians, I.W.W.‘ s-were immune to the ideological contagion. They could not be stung into joyous frenzy by a few polished slogans. “Socialism” was not a new word to them, as it was to the poets, painters, millionaires’ sons, dyspeptic clergymen and frustrated females who flocked to the Innocents’ Clubs. They could not be knocked cold with a column of Soviet statistics or bluffed into silence by threats of the fascist bogeyman. This history of the Red Decade would not be complete without a tribute to the authentic Left; their publications, through all the lunatic years of the Muscovite obsession, stand as a record of courage and good sense in the midst of intellectual panic.[^8]

> Those who ran afoul of the revolution were made to feel the full weight of their crimes; they were ostracized socially, handicapped professionally and not infrequently stripped of their jobs as well as their reputations for ordinary decency.[^9]

> Among the strangest of these manifestations was the adoption of the Cause by the swanky and the well-to-do. Caviar and vodka displaced the hammer and sickle as emblems of proletarian rebellion for these gilt-edged recruits. They fairly glowed with enthusiasm for their own speedy liquidation, and denounced “the system” that paid for this mock-revolutionary self-indulgence. Not one in a thousand among them sensed the contempt with which they were regarded by the less debauched of the communists. The outward flattery, the sensation of being let in on a conspiracy, went to their heads. For a growing number of ladies of leisure, and for some of their menfolks, communism took the place of mahjong as a favorite parlor game. They threw parties-for this or that cause. R.S.V.P. black tie, Archie dear.. yes, I’ve been promised a real proletarian .. so don’t fail to be there. Mink and ermine and starched shirt fronts became a matter of course at openings of plays endorsed by the New Masses and the New Theater, and at dance benefits for Stalinist causes. Limousines with liveried chauffeurs delivered earnest ladies to the picket lines, sometimes in strikes against businesses which helped pay for the limousines; they combined revolution with slimming exercises.[^10]

> The colossal irony of the situation was that the fellow-travelers, having thrown themselves into some stooge movement, really fancied themselves revolutionaries-precisely when Moscow communism had ceased to be revolutionary. They fancied themselves knight-errants of antifascism-while championing a special brand of fascism. But enough of the brave old nomenclature remained, enough of the revolutionary swagger, to give the mixture a beguiling shimmer of social daring. It was a perfect recipe for those Americans who wanted the thrill of revolutionary forms but none of their substance in blood and death and sacrifice.[^11]

> Supposed “intellectuals” were sure they were demolishing detailed reports on Russian realities by insulting the authors. I shall have more to say about the arts of character assassination as practiced against infidels. The process served essentially as a psychological trick for ignoring their views with a clear conscience. One day an apologetic stranger came to see me. He told me a heart-rending tale. It seems that his wife, a high-strung and good-natured woman, had devoted years of ardent effort to the communist movement. Several weeks before, she had heard me speak at a forum meeting at the Community Church of New York. What I had to report on Russia had shaken her faith. She came home that night and suffered a nervous breakdown. Now her husband came to plead that I go to the hospital and assure the woman that I had lied, that everything in Russia was lovely.”[^12]

> Nearly everywhere the Muscovite program took in men and women who should have known better. A.S.U. conferences now could count on the dean or president as chief speaker, along with some outside communists bringing greetings. The “peace strikes”-now a euphemism for collective security-could count in most places on faculty and administration support. Radical and liberal students and professors who saw through the fraud, who refused to join it or abandoned it in disillusionment, were persecuted as “Trotskyites,” boycotted and subjected to filthy character assaults.. [...]  A member of his faculty, Dr. Bernard Grebanier, having publicly broken with the communists, similarly found himself the target of carefully generaled attacks. He was ostracized by his former friends, snubbed by former admirers among the students, plastered with outrageous libels on his private life and character. For a time there were also open and partially successful boycotts of his courses.[^13]

> The controversy around the political identities of the American Student Union, the American Youth Congress and their associated fronts cannot be dismissed lightly. The communist strangle hold on Youth movements has left deep imprints on American life and thought. It is perhaps the strongest ingredient in that skepticism and disillusionment which is now making so many of our undergraduates indifferent to the fate of democracy. Thousands of those who were indoctrinated with communist amoralism will help to shape our American life of tomorrow. Many of them are today in places of strategic importance in our national life. Having regimented a sizable sector of our youth, the communists had no trouble in switching them from one political position to the exact contrary position.[^14]

> A species of panic was produced among foreign fellow-travelers by the repeated shocks of the Russian slaughter! Here and there individual communists in America and elsewhere went through a revulsion of feeling. But by and large the periphery of “sympathizers” and secret communists and vague camp-followers swallowed the blood purge as their forerunners had gulped down the man-made famine. It was in the midst of the purges, in fact, that the liberal middle and upper-class conversions to the Comintern religion had their greatest growth. No stronger proof can be adduced of the irrationality of the whole business. It thrived on blood. It derived a certain ecstasy from the continuous spectacle of human sacrifice. Nor is it the first time in the history of pseudo-religious obsessions that blood played this role of heightening emotion.[^15]

> Moscow’s seizure of a monopoly of antifascist emotion was the major Stalinist triumph of these years. It gave the communists an absolute moral authority over millions of men and women throughout the world who, at bottom, had no real sympathy with the Russian tyranny. That, more than any other single factor, made possible the amazing growth of People’s Fronts, Innocents’ Clubs, mythical united fronts, and the Stalinist intellectual terror sketched in these pages. And it was the strangle hold on Loyalist Spain which above all gave the communists that monopoly. That is why this chapter is part and parcel of the history of Bolshevism in America. The fight against Franco had become a symbol of democracy’s struggle for survival-Stalin grabbed that symbol and turned it into a Soviet racket.[^16]

> Fatuous American liberals worked with the party stalwarts to recruit volunteers for the communist-controlled foreign armies in Spain. They got the thrill of safe vicarious heroism by sending high-spirited, idealistic boys to their deaths. Of the thousands recruited here, not more than half returned. Most of them died in battle, the rest died at the hands of Stalin’s firing squads. Those who enlisted for definite periods, usually six months, were not allowed to leave when the term ended. All American passports were confiscated and are even now being used by Soviet espionage operatives all over the globe. Hundreds who were quickly disillusioned and dared to indicate it were “liquidated” or merely sent to spots where their liquidation by Franco was certain. Not a fraction of the ugly story has as yet been told. In line with the Fourth Period technique, the Stalinist volunteers were camouflaged with names like Abraham Lincoln Brigade-one can see Stalin smiling through his mustaches at the cynical trick. Dozens of these boys, having been alien residents in America at the time they joined the Brigade, could not return and are still languishing in concentration camps. The survivors who got back, penniless, often crippled, were helpless; through economic pressure many of them continued to play the roles of heroes for the comradely committees and a percentage of the collections. Those who refused were smeared in the party press and among their friends as spies or “Trotskyites.” But little things like that could not be allowed to interfere with penthouse parties. The racket went on long after democratic Spain was dead. High-minded liberals still gave their impeccable names as decoration for “rescue ships” and other gadgets which only the willfully blind could fail to recognize as communist stooge setups. I have no more than hinted at the obscenity. Stalin’s crime against Spain-and the joyful participation in it by gullible herds of Americans cannot be compassed in a chapter or a book. But even this sketchy outline may help us understand the Red Decade. The emotional leverage of Spain, the heroic symbolism of the struggle there, were forces utilized by the communists in Americans elsewhere, to penetrate deeper and still deeper into American life.[^17]

> In the heroic early days of the Russian Revolution, when being a Bolshevik meant social ostracism and real sacrifice, Hollywood was aware of it only as an occasional theme for slapstick comedy. Now that the revolution had degenerated into a dictated slaughterhouse, the cinema capital went whole-hog on the idea. Glamor girls and scenario maestros took personal credit for everything Lenin had done (though they remained extremely vague as to what it was) and threw in the French Revolution for good measure. It was not the first time, of course, that a comfortable upper class had revolted vicariously for the lower orders. [...] They had not the remotest idea what communism was in terms of economic structures or political superstates. For nearly all of them it was an intoxicated state of mind, a glow of inner virtue, and a sort of comradeship in super charity.[^18]

> It did wonders, too, for the self esteem of men and women who were at bottom ashamed of their status as intellectual slaves of the movie moguls; who dreamed of writing a great novel or taking Broadway by storm, but meanwhile had to be content with dunking in swimming pools. For years they had smarted under the jibes of envious but superior” intellectuals.” Now they were not only accepted by the intelligentsia but made to feel equals. Perhaps a few of them did realize that they were merely buying that bogus equality with cash contributions and contributions of their advertising value. But the rest glowed with a new self-importance. The Red Decade gave a lot of self-conscious lowbrows a chance to pose to themselves as heavy thinkers. They paid for the privilege, and gladly.[19]

> Under the tom foolery there was plenty of tough self-interest. For the younger members of the colony, avid for the fatter fleshpots, Stalinism became the shortcut to success. At “cause parties” they rubbed shoulders and bosoms with big shots they could not have met otherwise. Those who tried to detour the revolution, unless they were stars well fixed in the firmament, found themselves slipping from favor. It was at once a movement and a lobby, a religion and a racket.[^20]

> INTELLECTUAL and moral “red terror” spread through the areas under the influence of the incredible revolution, which meant particularly in New York, Hollywood, Washington, many college campuses and the more infected social sectors in all large cities. I am conscious that this charge will sound extreme to people without direct experience of the reach and firepower of the terror, and I do not know how to make it credible to skeptics. Only those who have been targets of the concerted and stubborn attacks, month after month, year after year, will know what I mean. But the terror was no less real because it was underground, underhanded and in the nature of the thing not readily subject to proof. It was a terror directed in general against critics of Russia and of its foreign activities. But the fullest force of its mud gunners, character assassins and poison-gas brigades was reserved especially for “renegades,” meaning people who were at one time in the political environs of the Communist Party but had shaken off its authority. I have known men and women so frightened by the certainty of persecution from the Left that they hid their doubts and disillusionments like criminal secrets. The prospect of being branded, a thousand times, over a fascist, Trotskyite, Franco spy, agent of Hitler and Japan, tool of Hearst, lackey of Wall Street and the Liberty League has kept hundreds of comrades toeing the party line long after their faith had turned to ashes. They knew that the vilification would not be limited to political name-calling but would spread into fantastic personal smearing with whispered accusations from simple embezzlement and pimping to subtle corruptions even unto murder. They knew-and that was the most efficacious part of the business-that thereafter they would automatically be ostracized not alone by former friends and comrades but by that whole broad social, literary and intellectual periphery.[^21]

> THERE is nothing either remarkable or reprehensible in people changing their minds. Consistency is an overrated virtue too often merely a euphemism for congealed and outlived attitudes. It takes a lot more courage to renounce a cherished faith that has soured than to pretend it still smells sweetly. Loyalty to one’s conscience and intellectual integrity may transcend loyalty to a set of beliefs. But when millions of people in all parts of the world change their minds on the same subject simultaneously, as if on a signal, there is cause for suspicion. When the simultaneous somersaults are executed everywhere with the same gestures, accompanied by the same shouting, the suspicion is deepened to a certainty. Only a miracle or a conspiracy can explain such extraordinary coincidence. The complete about-turn in communist policy and principle with the consummation of the red-and-brown merger was no miracle.[^22]

> Mr. Villard’s statement is worth quoting because it speaks for tens of thousands who have at various times been lured into the communist corrals. “I went in under a mistaken impression,” he explained. “When they came to me they showed me a list of half a dozen sponsors, friends of mine and known non-fellow-travelers I gave my name on the strength of theirs. I learned that it was actually being run by the communists and got out just as fast as I could. The trouble is that liberals are always being roped in by seeing names of their friends.”[^23]
